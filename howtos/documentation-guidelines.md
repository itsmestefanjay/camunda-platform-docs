# Documentation Guidelines

## PRs for every change

All changes have to be done in a separate Branch. As soon as the changes are done please open a PR. A Github Action runs with every commit to a Branch and checks if the documentation can be build (including a broken links check).

PRs should be in a draft status while being actively worked. Removing a PR from draft status indicates they are ready for review (by a technical writer).

## Labeling PRs

PRs can be labeled “hold” by engineering teams for any reason, including ongoing conversations, coordination across teams or departments, or anything that’s not obvious within the discussion or description of the PR.

PRs labeled “bug” will be merged and released as immediately as possible.

## Not all PRs require an issue

In the spirit of "Always Progress", if you are confident you know what change needs to be made a separate issue on the topic is not required. However, if you have an idea that needs to go into the backlog, creating an issue instead of a PR is the best way to go.

## Structure

- Name Markdown files according to the title. This makes it easier to find a file. Example: **Introduction to Camunda Platform 8** --> `introduction-to-camunda-platform-8.md`. Avoid non-alphanumeric characters in titles. Use the file name as internal document id to reference in [the appropriate sidebars file](#sidebar-navigation).
- Sub categories have to be placed in their own sub directories. Example: Guides/Update Guide can be found in `docs/guides/update-guide`.

## Instances: Docs vs Optimize

Due to a difference in version numbers, the documentation is split into [multiple Docusaurus "instances"](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-multi-instance). Documentation specific to Optimize lives in the `optimize` instance, and all other documentation lives in the main `docs` instance.

## Versions

[Each instance of the documentation](#instances-docs-vs-optimize) contains documentation for multiple versions:

| Instance   | Version(s)               | Source path                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs`     | Next                     | [/docs/](../docs/)                                                  |
| `docs`     | 8.1, 8.0, 1.3, ...       | [/versioned_docs/version-\*/](../versioned_docs/)                   |
| `optimize` | Next                     | [/optimize/](../optimize/)                                          |
| `optimize` | 3.9.0, 3.8.0, 3.7.0, ... | [/optimize_versioned_docs/version-\*/](../optimize_versioned_docs/) |

When edits are intended to apply to both the current version _and beyond_, they should be made in both the most recent versioned folder and the "Next" version folder.

### Version alignment

Specific Optimize versions are aligned with Camunda Platform versions as follows:

| Camunda Platform version | Optimize version |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 8.1                      | 3.9.0            |
| 8.0                      | 3.8.0            |
| 1.3                      | 3.7.0            |

## Sidebar navigation

[Sidebar navigation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) of the documentation is managed in the sidebars files. [Each instance of the documentation](#instances-docs-vs-optimize) has its own sidebars file:

| Instance   | Version(s)               | Sidebars path                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs`     | Next                     | [/docs/sidebars.js](../sidebars.js)                                                       |
| `docs`     | 8.1, 8.0, 1.3, ...       | [/versioned_sidebars/version-\*-sidebars.json](../versioned_sidebars/)                    |
| `optimize` | Next                     | [/optimize/sidebars.js](../optimize_sidebars.js)                                          |
| `optimize` | 3.9.0, 3.8.0, 3.7.0, ... | [/optimize_versioned_sidebars/version-\*-sidebars.json/](../optimize_versioned_sidebars/) |

### Sidebar items

The large object in each sidebars file contains two different types of items:

- Items within the same [documentation instance](#instances-docs-vs-optimize) are [linked by the path to the target .md file](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/89993fbc1446c203324f38139ae7eb40e19b14ac/versioned_sidebars/version-8.1-sidebars.json#L5):
  ```json
  "guides/introduction-to-camunda",
  ```
- Items in the opposite [documentation instance](#instances-docs-vs-optimize) are [linked by an object containing the title and URL of the target document](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/89993fbc1446c203324f38139ae7eb40e19b14ac/versioned_sidebars/version-8.1-sidebars.json#L331-L335):
  ```json
  {
    "type": "link",
    "label": "What is Optimize?",
    "href": "/optimize/components/what-is-optimize/"
  },
  ```

> **Note**
> The "next" versions of the docs are JavaScript rather than JSON. As such, [cross-instance sidebar items in these files](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/main/sidebars.js#L266) call a helper function instead of emitting the entire cross-instance object for each item.

### Synchronization of sidebars

Several sections of the sidebar navigation are shared across the Optimize and main sections of the docs: Components, Self-Managed, and APIs & Clients. For these sections, the structure of the sidebars should always match across instances. [When they drift](./versioning.md#sidebar-drift), it appears to the user as differences in the sidebar navigation depending on which page they're viewing.

Any PRs that make a structural change to one of the instance's sidebars file in a shared section should make the same structural change to the other instance's sidebars file. This typically appears as a link to the target .md file in one file, and an object containing the target title and URL in the other file.

> **Note**
> Changes outside of the shared sections do not need to be synchronized to the corresponding Optimize sidebars file.

## Internal links

When linking internally from one document to another, follow these guidelines:

- if the source and target document are within the same instance (i.e. both are in `docs` or both are in `optimize`):
  - Use a relative path to the target markdown file if it is in the same subtree as the source file. [See example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/930a0c384b48be27d0bc66216015404f67716f61/docs/components/console/introduction-to-console.md?plain=1#L10).
  - Use an absolute path to the target markdown file if it is in a different subtree than the source file. [See example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/930a0c384b48be27d0bc66216015404f67716f61/docs/apis-clients/community-clients/spring.md?plain=1#L8).
  - Always include the `.md` extension in the path.
- if the source and target document are in different instances (i.e. one is in `docs` and the other is in `optimize`):
  - If the source is in `docs` and the target is in `optimize`, use the `$optimize$` token to prefix the URL. [See example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/930a0c384b48be27d0bc66216015404f67716f61/docs/guides/setting-up-development-project.md?plain=1#L17).
  - If the source is in `optimize` and the target is in `docs`, use the `$docs$` token to prefix the URL. [See example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/930a0c384b48be27d0bc66216015404f67716f61/optimize/components/what-is-optimize.md?plain=1#L8).
  - Use the browser-facing _URL_ to the target document, instead of the path to the target's `.md` file.
  - Do not include the `.md` extension on the target path.

## Adding a new documentation page

1. Select the corresponding directory.
2. Add the document id to [the corresponding sidebars file](#sidebar-navigation). [Example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/main/versioned_sidebars/version-8.1-sidebars.json#L47):
   ```json
   " components/components-overview",
   ```
3. If the doc is [in one of the shared sections](#synchronization-of-sidebars), add a parallel change to [the other instance's corresponding sidebars file](#sidebar-navigation). [Example](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/blob/main/optimize_versioned_sidebars/version-3.9.0-sidebars.json#L3-L7):
   ```json
   {
     "type": "link",
     "label": "Overview Components",
     "href": "/docs/components/"
   },
   ```

## Moving an existing page

1. Identify the page, pages, or directory and relocate it in the file structure.
2. Update [the corresponding sidebars file(s)](#sidebar-navigation) to fit the new location.
3. If the doc is [in one of the shared sections](#synchronization-of-sidebars), update [the opposite instance's corresponding sidebars file(s)](#sidebar-navigation).
4. Add necessary redirect/rewrite rules to the top of `.htaccess`.

See [Redirect rules](#redirect-rules) for information on testing `.htaccess` rules.

## Remove an existing page

1. Identify the page, pages, or directory and delete it in the file structure.
2. Update [the corresponding sidebars file(s)](#sidebar-navigation).
3. If the doc is [in one of the shared sections](#synchronization-of-sidebars), update [the opposite instance's corresponding sidebars file(s)](#sidebar-navigation).
4. Add necessary redirect/rewrite rules to the top of `.htaccess` to redirect users to appropriate relevant content on another page.

See [Redirect rules](#redirect-rules) for information on testing `.htaccess` rules.

## Redirect rules

The `build-docs` workflow of each PR runs a step to verify that all links present in the production sitemap are still valid. If your build fails on the "Check internal links" step, it likely means you moved a doc. To resolve, you can add a redirect rule to [the .htaccess file](../static/.htaccess), mapping the old URL to the new URL.

### Testing redirect rules

The `.htaccess` file contains redirect rules that are applied to the published site, but it has no effect when running docusaurus locally (via `npm start`).

If you wish to test `.htaccess` rules, you have a couple options:

1. Use online tooling to test rules.
   Tools like https://htaccess.madewithlove.com/ apply a set of redirect rules to a specific URL. Note that there are edge cases where this tool doesn't give the same results as a published environment.

2. Use `docker compose` to spin up a locally-running Apache webserver.
   This repo includes Docker configuration ([Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)) to spin up a local environment that better simulates a published environment. Redirect rules can then be tested directly in a browser.

   The local server is based on the contents of your `./build` folder.

   **To start the local server**:

   1. Build the docs with `npm run build`.
   2. Start the server with `docker compose up`.
   3. Browse http://localhost:3001 and test redirects.

      It is probably best to do this in an incognito browser session, as browsers clutch tightly to 301 redirects.

   4. Clean up the server with `docker compose down`.

   **If you make changes and want to re-start the server**:

   1. Apply the changes to your `build` folder, either manually or by re-running `npm run build`.
   2. Rebuild the environment with `docker compose build`.
   3. Re-start the server with `docker compose up`.
   4. Clean up the server with `docker compose down`.

## Screenshot automation

In an effort to automate screenshots across Camunda Platform 8 documentation, the following teams execute uniform steps when incorporating images and diagrams:

:::note
Given the following procedures, teams will respond to screenshot updates and suggestions from community members by manually adjusting appropriate screenshots.
:::

**Modeler**
Visit the [Modeler screenshot automation repo](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs-modeler-screenshots/blob/main/README.md) for details on updating screenshots and scripting new screenshots.

**Zeebe**
Currently, Zeebe diagrams are stored as BPMN in a [repository](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform-docs/tree/main/media-src/product-manuals/zeebe), and as diagrams within Google Drive. This Google Drive is organized according to the structure of documentation in `camunda-platform-docs`.

:::note
When saving diagrams, we should not take manual screenshots. Rather, authors should incorporate diagrams directly via **Download > PNG image (.png)**.
:::

Keep the following guidelines in mind when creating Zeebe diagrams:

- The standardized font is **Arial**. Font size may vary based on diagram size.
- The standardized colors for diagrams are **`#0d8dba`** and **orange** with the default background color of **white**.
- Rectangular diagrams should be around **500x1200px**, and square diagrams should be around **500x500px**.
- There should be no more than **nine** elements per diagram. Otherwise, complex processes may be broken into more than one diagram.

**Operate & Tasklist**
Operate and Tasklist screenshot automation is currently in the backlog.

**Optimize**
Most of the screenshots in the user guide can be updated automatically:

1. Check out the [camunda-optimize](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-optimize) repository.
2. In the `/client` directory of the `camunda-optimize` repository, start the frontend development setup by running `yarn run start-backend` and `yarn start`.
3. Wait for the data to be generated and imported and then run `yarn run screenshots`.

On a technical level, the Optimize team takes screenshots within their [end-to-end test cases](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-optimize/blob/master/client/e2e/tests/Dashboard.js#L33).

## Review Process
