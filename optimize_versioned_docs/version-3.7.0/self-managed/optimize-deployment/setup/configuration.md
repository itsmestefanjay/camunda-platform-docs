## Logging

Camunda Optimize provides logging facilities that are preconfigured to use
_INFO_ logging level which provides minimal output of information in log files.
This level can be adjusted using the `environment-logback.xml` configuration file.

Even though one could potentially configure logging levels for all packages, it
is recommended to set logging levels for the following three Optimize parts only using exact package
reference as follows:

* Optimize runtime environment:

```xml
<logger name="org.camunda.optimize" level="info" />
```

* Optimize update:

```xml
<logger name="org.camunda.optimize.update" level="info">
  <appender-ref ref="UPGRADE"/>
</logger>
```

* Communication to Elasticsearch:

```xml
<logger name="org.elasticsearch" level="warn" />
```

If you are running Optimize with Docker, you can use the following environment variables to configure its logging levels.

- `OPTIMIZE_LOG_LEVEL` sets the logging level for the Optimize log
- `UPGRADE_LOG_LEVEL` sets the logging level for the Optimize update log
- `ES_LOG_LEVEL` sets the logging level for Elasticsearch

Whether using the configuration file or Docker environment variables, to define the granularity of the information shown in the log you can set one of the following log levels:

- **error**: shows errors only.
- **warn**: like **error**, but displays warnings as well.
- **info**: logs everything from **warn** and the most important information about state changes or actions in Optimize.
- **debug**: in addition to **info**, writes information about the scheduling process, alerting as well as the import of the engine data.
- **trace**: like **debug**, but in addition, writes all requests sent to the Camunda engine as well as all queries towards Elasticsearch to the log output.

## System configuration

All distributions of Camunda Optimize come with a predefined set of configuration options that can be overwritten by the user, based on current environment requirements. To do that, have a look into the folder named `config` which contains a file called `environment-config.yaml` with values that override the default Optimize properties.

You can see a sample configuration file with all possible configuration fields
and their default values [here](service-config.yaml).

In the following section, you will find descriptions and default values of the configuration fields with their respective YAML path.

:::note Heads Up
For changes in the configuration to take effect, you need to restart Optimize!
:::

### Java system properties & OS environment variable placeholders

To externalize configuration properties from the `environment-config.yaml`, Optimize provides variable placeholder support.

The order in which placeholders are resolved is the following:

1. Java system properties
2. OS environment variables

The placeholder format is `${VARIABLE_NAME}` and allows you to refer to a value of a Java system property or OS environment variable of your choice.
The `VARIABLE_NAME` is required to contain only lowercase or uppercase letters, digits and underscore `_` characters and shall not begin with a digit. The corresponding regular expression is `([a-zA-Z_]+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*)`.

The following example illustrates the usage:

```
security:
  auth:
    token:
      secret: ${AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET}
```

Given this variable is set before Optimize is started, for example on Unix systems with:

```
export AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=sampleTokenValue
```

The value will be resolved at startup to `sampleTokenValue`.

However, if the same variable is provided at the same time as a Java system property, for example via passing `-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue` to the Optimize startup script:

```
./optimize-startup.sh -DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue
```

The value would be resolved to `othertokenValue` as Java system properties have precedence over OS environment variables.

:::note
For Windows users, to pass Java system properties to the provided Windows Batch script `optimize-startup.bat`, you have to put them into double quotes when using the `cmd.exe` shell, as shown below.
:::

```
optimize-startup.bat "-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue"
```

For the Windows Powershell in three double quotes:

```
./optimize-startup.bat """-DAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=othertokenValue"""
```

#### Default values

For variable placeholders it's also possible to provide default values using the following format: `${VARIABLE_NAME:DEFAULT_VALUE}`. The `DEFAULT_VALUE` can contain any character except `}`.

The following example illustrates the usage:

```
security:
  auth:
    token:
      secret: ${AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET:defaultSecret}
```

### Security

These values control mechanisms of Optimize related security, e.g. security headers and authentication.

| YAML Path | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - |
|  |
| security.auth.token.lifeMin | 60 | Optimize uses token-based authentication to keep track of which users are logged in. Define the lifetime of the token in minutes. |
| security.auth.token.secret | null | Optional secret used to sign authentication tokens, it's recommended to use at least a 64-character secret. If set to `null` a random secret will be generated with each startup of Optimize. |
| security.auth.superUserIds | [ ] | List of user IDs that are granted full permission to all collections, reports, and dashboards. <br /><br /> Note: For reports, these users are still required to be granted access to the corresponding process/decision definitions in Camunda Platform Admin. See [Authorization Management](./authorization-management.md). |
| security.auth.superGroupIds | [ ] | List of group IDs that are granted full permission to all collections, reports, and dashboards. All members of the groups specified will have superuser permissions in Optimize. <br /><br />Note: For reports, these groups are still required to be granted access to the corresponding process/decision definitions in Camunda Platform Admin. See [Authorization Management](./authorization-management.md). |
| security.responseHeaders.HSTS.max-age | 31536000 | HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. This field defines the time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that this site is only to be accessed using HTTPS. If you set the number to a negative value no HSTS header is sent. |
| security.responseHeaders.HSTS.includeSubDomains | true | HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. If this optional parameter is specified, this rule applies to all the siteâ€™s subdomains as well. |
| security.responseHeaders.X-XSS-Protection | 1; mode=block   | This header enables the cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in your browser. Can have one of the following options:<ul><li>   `0`: Filter disabled. </li><li>    `1`: Filter enabled. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, in order to stop the attack, the browser will sanitize the page. </li><li>    `1; mode=block`: Filter enabled. Rather than sanitize the page, when a XSS attack is detected, the browser will prevent rendering of the page.</li><li>    `1; report=http://[YOURDOMAIN]/your_report_URI`: Filter enabled. The browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This is a Chromium function utilizing CSP violation reports to send details to a URI of your choice.</li></ul> |
| security.responseHeaders.X-Content-Type-Options  | true            | Setting this header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as a different MIME type to what is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header (e.g. treating text/plain as text/css). |
| security.responseHeaders.Content-Security-Policy | base-uri 'self' | A Content Security Policy (CSP) has significant impact on the way browsers render pages. By default Optimize uses the base-uri directive which restricts the URLs that can be used to the Optimize pages. Find more details in [Mozilla's Content Security Policy Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy). |

### Public API

### Connection to Camunda Platform

Configuration for engines used to import data. Note that you have to have
at least one engine configured at all times. You can configure multiple engines
to import data from. Each engine configuration should have a unique alias associated
with it and represented by `${engineAlias}`.

Note that each connected engine must have its respective history level set to `FULL` in order to see all available data
in Optimize. Using any other history level will result in less data and/or functionality within Optimize.

|YAML Path|Default Value|Description|

### Elasticsearch

Settings related to Elasticsearch.

#### Connection settings

Everything that is related to building the connection to Elasticsearch.

Please note that you can define a number of connection points
in a cluster. Therefore, everything that is under `es.connection.nodes` is a list of nodes Optimize can connect to.
If you have built an Elasticsearch cluster with several nodes it is recommended to define several connection points so that
if one node fails, Optimize is still able to talk to the cluster.

|YAML Path|Default Value|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|es.connection.timeout|10000|Maximum time without connection to Elasticsearch that Optimize should wait until a timeout triggers.|
|es.connection.responseConsumerBufferLimitInMb|100|Maximum size of the Elasticsearch response consumer heap buffer. This can be increased to resolve errors from Elasticsearch relating to the entity content being too long|

#### Index settings

|YAML Path|Default Value|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|es.settings.index.prefix|optimize|The prefix prepended to all Optimize index and alias names. Custom values allow to operate multiple isolated Optimize instances on one Elasticsearch cluster. <br /><br />NOTE: Changing this after Optimize was already run before will create new empty indexes.|
|es.settings.index.number_of_replicas|1|How often data should be replicated to handle node failures.|
|es.settings.index.number_of_shards|1|How many shards should be used in the cluster for process instance and decision instance indices. All other indices will be made up of a single shard. <br /><br />Note: this property only applies the first time Optimize is started and the schema/mapping is deployed on Elasticsearch. If you want this property to take effect again, you need to delete all indices (and with that all data) and restart Optimize.|
|es.settings.index.refresh_interval|2s|How long Elasticsearch waits until the documents are available for search. A positive value defines the duration in seconds. A value of -1 means that a refresh needs to be done manually.|
|es.settings.index.nested_documents_limit|10000|Optimize uses nested documents to store list information such as activities or variables belonging to a process instance. This setting defines the maximum number of activities/variables/incidents that a single process instance can contain. This limit helps to prevent out of memory errors and should be used with care. For more information, please refer to the Elasticsearch documentation on this topic.|


#### Elasticsearch Security

| YAML Path | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| historyCleanup.cronTrigger | `'0 1 * * *'` | Cron expression to schedule when the cleanup should be executed, defaults to 01:00 A.M. As the cleanup can cause considerable load on the underlying Elasticsearch database it is recommended to schedule it outside of office hours. You can either use the default Cron (5 fields) or the Spring Cron (6 fields) expression format here.  For details on the format please refer to: [Cron Expression Description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or [Spring Cron Expression Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html) |

For process data, it's the `endTime` of the process instance. For decision data, it's the `evaluationTime` and for ingested events it's the `time` field. The format of the string is ISO_8601 duration. The default value is 2 years.  For details on the notation refer to: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) Note: The time component of the ISO_8601 duration is not supported.

|eventBasedProcess.eventIndexRollover.maxIndexSizeGB|50|Specifies the maximum total index size for events (excluding replicas). When shards get too large, query performance can slow down and rolling over an index can bring an improvement. Using this configuration, a rollover will occur when triggered and the current event index size matches or exceeds the maxIndexSizeGB threshold.|

### Event Ingestion REST API Configuration

Configuration of the Optimize [Event Ingestion REST API](../../rest-api/event-ingestion) for [Event Based Processes](../../../components/userguide/additional-features/event-based-processes.md).

|externalVariable.import.enabled|false|Controls whether external ingested variable data is processed and imported to process instance data.|
|externalVariable.import.maxPageSize|10000|Determines the page size for the import of ingested external variable data to process instance data.|
|externalVariable.variableIndexRollover.maxIndexSizeGB|50|Specifies the maximum size for the external variable index. When shards get too large, query performance can slow down and rolling over an index can bring an improvement. Using this configuration, a rollover will occur when the current external variable index size matches or exceeds the maxIndexSizeGB threshold.|
|externalVariable.variableIndexRollover.scheduleIntervalInMinutes|10|The interval in minutes at which to check whether the conditions for a rollover of the external variable index are met, triggering one if required. This value should be greater than 0.|
|externalVariable.variableIngestion.maxBatchRequestBytes|10485760|Content length limit for a variable ingestion REST API bulk request in bytes. Requests will be rejected when exceeding that limit. Defaults to 10MB. In case this limit is raised you should carefully tune the heap memory accordingly, see Adjust Optimize heap size on how to do that.|
|externalVariable.variableIngestion.maxRequests|5|The maximum number of variable ingestion requests that can be serviced at any given time.|


### Telemetry Configuration

Configuration of initial telemetry settings.

|YAML Path|Default Value|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|telemetry.initializeTelemetry|false|Decides whether telemetry is initially enabled or disabled when Optimize starts. Thereafter, telemetry can be turned on and off in the UI by superusers. If enabled, information about the setup and usage of the Optimize is sent to remote Camunda servers for the sake of analytical evaluation. When enabled, the following information is sent every 24 hours: Optimize version, License Key, Optimize installation ID, Elasticsearch version. <br /><br />Legal note: Before you install Camunda Optimize version >= 3.2.0 or activate the telemetric functionality, please make sure that you are authorized to take this step, and that the installation or activation of the telemetric functionality is not in conflict with any internal company policies, compliance guidelines, any contractual or other provisions or obligations of your company. Camunda cannot be held responsible in the event of unauthorized installation or activation of this function.|

### Other

Settings of plugin subsystem serialization format, variable import, Camunda endpoint.

| YAML Path | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| plugin.directory | ./plugin | Defines the directory path in the local Optimize file system which should be checked for plugins. |
| plugin.variableImport.basePackages |     | Look in the given base package list for variable import adaption plugins. If empty, the import is not influenced. |
| plugin.authenticationExtractor.basePackages |     | Looks in the given base package list for authentication extractor plugins. If empty, the standard Optimize authentication mechanism is used. |
| plugin.engineRestFilter.basePackages |     | Look in the given base package list for engine rest filter plugins. If empty, the REST calls are not influenced. |
| plugin.decisionInputImport.basePackages |     | Look in the given base package list for Decision input import adaption plugins. If empty, the import is not influenced. |
| plugin.decisionOutputImport.basePackages |     | Look in the given base package list for Decision output import adaption plugins. If empty, the import is not influenced. |
| plugin.elasticsearchCustomHeader.basePackages |     | Look in the given base package list for Elasticsearch custom header plugins. If empty, Elasticsearch requests are not influenced. |
| serialization.engineDateFormat | yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ | Define a custom date format that should be used (should be the same as in the engine). |
| export.csv.limit | 1000 | Maximum number of records returned by CSV export.<br /><br /> Note: Increasing this value comes at a memory cost for the Optimize application that varies based on the actual data. As a rough guideline, an export of a 50000 raw data report records containing 8 variables on each instance can cause temporary heap memory peaks of up to ~200MB with the actual CSV file having a size of ~20MB. Please adjust the heap memory accordingly, see [Adjust Optimize heap size](../installation/#adjust-optimize-heap-size) on how to do that. |
| export.csv.delimiter | ,   | The delimiter used for the CSV export. The value defaults to a comma, however other common CSV delimiters such as semicolons (";") and tabs ("\\t") can also be used. |
| sharing.enabled | true | Enable/disable the possibility to share reports and dashboards. |
