To create a group using Identity, take the following steps:

1. Log in to the Identity UI and navigate to the **Groups** tab:

![create-group-tab](../img/create-group-tab.png)

2. Click the **Add Group** button located on the top right of the table and a modal will open:

![create-group-modal-1](../img/create-group-modal-1.png)

1. Fill in the name of the group. For this guide, we use an example value. After inserting the name, click **Add**:

![create-group-modal-2](../img/create-group-modal-2.png)

On confirmation, the modal closes, the table updates, and your new group is shown:
