In this guide we will show you how to use Identity to assign users to a group.

:::caution Write access needed
To assign a user to a group, you must have write access to Identity.
Read our [guide on managing user access](../managing-user-access.md) to learn more.
:::

1. Log in to the Identity UI and navigate to the **Groups** tab. Select the group you would like to assign a user to from the table:

2. Click **Assign Members** and a modal will open:

3. Search and select the users to assign to the group. After selecting the users, click **Assign**:

On confirmation, the modal closes, the table updates, and your assigned members are shown:
