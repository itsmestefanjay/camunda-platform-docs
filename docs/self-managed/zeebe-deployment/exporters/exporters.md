Zeebe comes packaged with two exporters:

- [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch-exporter.md)
- [OpenSearch](opensearch-exporter.md)

This section of the docs explains how these exporters can be configured. For a general overview on the exporters concept, refer to our [exporters concept](../../concepts/exporters.md) page.
