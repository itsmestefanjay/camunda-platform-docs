title: Update 0.6 to 0.7

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

With the Connector SDK [0.7.0 release](https://github.com/camunda/connector-sdk/releases/tag/0.7.0), we made breaking changes to the inbound
[HTTP webhook Connector](../../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/http-webhook)
and [GitHub webhook Connector](../../../../components/connectors/out-of-the-box-connectors/github-webhook).

If you have used inbound webhook Connectors with Connector Runtime 0.6.x, you need to **manually**
apply the new element template version to your diagrams:

1. Download the new element template from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/camunda/connectors-bundle/releases/tag/0.17.0).
2. Follow the [installation guide](../../../../components/modeler/desktop-modeler/element-templates/configuring-templates) to reinstall the element template.
