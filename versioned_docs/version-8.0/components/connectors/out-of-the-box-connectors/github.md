The **GitHub Connector** allows you to connect your BPMN service with [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Prerequisites

To use the **GitHub Connector**, you must have a GitHub instance and an [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) of a user or a service account on whose behalf a BPMN process will be executed.

:::note
It is highly recommended not to expose your GitHub access token credentials as plain text. Instead, use Camunda secrets.
See our documentation on [managing secrets](../../../components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets.md) to learn more.

## Create a GitHub Connector task

To use the **GitHub Connector** in your process, either change the type of existing task by clicking on it and using the wrench-shaped **Change type** context menu icon, or create a new Connector task using the **Append Connector** context menu. Follow our [guide to using Connectors](../use-connectors.md) to learn more.

## Provide your access token

In the **Authentication** section, provide a **GitHub access token**.

## Select operation to execute

The **GitHub Connector** currently supports the following operations.

## Handle Connector response

The **GitLab Connector** is a protocol Connector, meaning it is built on top of the **HTTP REST Connector**, therefore
handling response is still applicable [as described](./rest.md#response).
