Let's analyse a few examples utilizing Java to deploy a process, open a job worker, handle variables, and request cluster topology.

These examples are accessible in the [Camunda Community Hub Repository](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/camunda-8-examples).

Instructions to access code locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe.git
git checkout develop
cd samples
```

Import the Maven project in the `samples` directory into your IDE to start hacking.

## Process
