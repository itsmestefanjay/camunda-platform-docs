Zeebe is the process automation engine powering Camunda Cloud. While written in Java, you do not need to be a Java developer to use Zeebe.

With Zeebe you can:

- Define processes graphically in [BPMN 2.0](reference/bpmn-processes/bpmn-coverage.md).
- Choose any [gRPC](/apis-tools/grpc.md)-supported programming language to implement your workers.
- Build processes that react to events from Apache Kafka and other messaging platforms.
- Use as part of a SaaS offering with Camunda Cloud or deploy with Docker and Kubernetes (in the cloud or on-premises) with Camunda Cloud Self-Managed.
- Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput.
- Rely on fault tolerance and high availability for your processes.
- Export processes data for monitoring and analysis (currently only available through the [Elasticsearch exporter](https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/tree/develop/exporters/elasticsearch-exporter) added in Camunda Cloud Self-Managed).
- Engage with an active community.

For documentation on deploying Zeebe as part of Camunda Cloud Self-Managed, please refer to the [deployment guide](/self-managed/zeebe-deployment/index.md).
